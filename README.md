# Bitcoin in Python

This is a dead simple implementstion of the Bitcoin protocol in Python. I'm Trying to build another app that lets common accounting software have a bitcoin native interface. But I kept getting tripped up on various aspects of the project because my knowledge of bitcoin is high level. To fix this I decided to write a simple implementation of the bitcoin protocol in python.
